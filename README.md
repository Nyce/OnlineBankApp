# OnlineBankApp

App Name: OnlineBankApp

Author: Niyi Odumosu

Version: 1.0


Summary:

This app is a dynamic web app that serves as the client for my BankServiceApp. It is built on the Java language using the Spring MVC framework. Using the BankServiceApp for functionality, the user can perform CRUD operations such as opening a new account, logging in, and creating new transactions such as deposit and withdrawal. I will continue to enhance the online banking capabilities as the scope of the project increases.
